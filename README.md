## Enhanced Node Readability

### Semantic Node Categories

Visor now provides enhanced visual differentiation through semantic node categorization:

- **Entry/Exit Nodes** (Round with double borders): Function start and end points
- **Decision Nodes** (Diamond with dashed borders): Conditionals, loops, and branching logic
- **Process Nodes** (Rectangle with solid borders): Regular statements and assignments
- **Loop Control** (Stadium): Loop end markers and control flow
- **Exception Handling** (Stadium with dotted borders): Try/catch/finally blocks
- **Assignment Nodes** (Rectangle): Variable assignments and declarations
- **Function Calls** (Rectangle): External function invocations
- **Return Nodes** (Stadium): Function return statements
- **Break/Continue** (Rectangle with dashed borders): Control flow interruption

### Subtle Visual Enhancement

The design maintains professionalism while improving comprehension through:

- **Theme-Aware Colors**: Subtle accent colors that respect VS Code's theme preferences
- **Enhanced Typography**: Improved font weights and sizing for better legibility
- **Smart Hover Effects**: Gentle visual feedback without overwhelming the interface
- **Consistent Visual Hierarchy**: Different node types use consistent visual patterns
- **Accessibility**: High contrast support and reduced motion options
- **Complexity Indicators**: Visual markers (‚ö†Ô∏è üî¥ üö®) on nodes with high cyclomatic complexity

### Configuration

Access theme and complexity settings via VS Code Settings (`Cmd/Ctrl + ,`) under "Visor":

```json
{
  "visor.nodeReadability.theme": "monokai",
  "visor.complexity.enabled": true,
  "visor.complexity.displayInNodes": true,
  "visor.complexity.displayInPanel": true,
  "visor.complexity.thresholds.low": 5,
  "visor.complexity.thresholds.medium": 10,
  "visor.complexity.thresholds.high": 20
}
```

## How to Use

### Getting Started

1. **Install the Extension**: Search for "Visor" in the VS Code Extensions marketplace
2. **Open a Supported File**: Open any Python, TypeScript, JavaScript, Java, C, or C++ file
3. **Access the Flowchart**:
   - **Sidebar View**: Click the Visor icon in the Activity Bar (left sidebar)
   - **External Window**: Use the command palette (`Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + P`) and run "Visor: Generate Flowchart" or click the üöÄ "Open in New Window" button

### Navigation & Interaction

1. **Function Selection**: Place your cursor inside any function - the flowchart updates automatically
2. **Code Navigation**: Click any node in the flowchart to jump to the corresponding code
3. **Live Highlighting**: Move your cursor through the code to see real-time highlighting in the flowchart

- **Multi-Window Support**: Complexity information is available in both sidebar and external window views

### Working with External Windows

Visor supports opening flowcharts in dedicated external windows for enhanced productivity:

**Benefits:**

- **Multi-Monitor Workflows**: Place flowchart on secondary monitor while coding on primary
- **Larger View Area**: More space for complex flowcharts without sacrificing code editor space
- **Independent Navigation**: Pan and zoom without affecting your code editor
- **Persistent State**: Windows remember their position and zoom level

**Usage:**

1. **From Sidebar**: Click the üöÄ "Open in New Window" button in the sidebar view
2. **From Command Palette**: Run "Visor: Generate Flowchart" (`Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + P`)
3. **Automatic Sync**: External windows automatically update when you navigate to different functions
4. **Reliable Updates**: Enhanced event handling ensures flowcharts generate consistently across window switches

**Features in External Windows:**

- Full pan and zoom controls
