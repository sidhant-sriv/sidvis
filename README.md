# Visor: Multi-Language Code-to-Flowchart Visualization

**Visor** is a powerful VS Code extension that generates **real-time, interactive flowcharts** for your code. It helps you understand, debug, and document complex logic by transforming it into a clear visual representation.

---

### Features ‚ú®

- **Real-Time Flowchart Generation**: Flowcharts automatically update as you navigate or edit your code. Place your cursor inside a function, and Visor instantly visualizes its logic.
- **Bidirectional Navigation**: Click on a node in the flowchart to jump to the corresponding code, and watch the flowchart highlight as you move your cursor through the code.
- **Multi-Language Support**: Works out of the box with **Python, TypeScript/JavaScript, Java, C++, C, and Rust**. It supports a wide range of code constructs including functions, classes, loops, conditionals, and exceptions.
- **Cyclomatic Complexity Analysis**: Get instant feedback on your code's complexity with real-time metrics and visual indicators (‚ö†Ô∏è, üî¥, üö®) on complex nodes.
- **Enhanced Readability**: Flowcharts use **semantic nodes** to visually distinguish between different code elements‚Äîlike decisions (diamond shape), loops (stadium shape), and processes (rectangle). The design is theme-aware and professionally styled.
- **Flexible Viewing**: View flowcharts in the VS Code sidebar or in a dedicated external window, perfect for multi-monitor setups.
- **Export Capabilities**: Easily export your flowcharts as high-quality **SVG** (vector) or **PNG** (raster) images for documentation.

### Configuration ‚öôÔ∏è

You can customize Visor's behavior through the VS Code settings (`Cmd/Ctrl + ,`). Search for "Visor" to adjust settings for:

- **Complexity Thresholds**: Set your own ratings for low, medium, and high complexity.
- **Visuals**: Customize how complexity indicators are displayed.

<!-- end list -->

```json
{
  "visor.complexity.enabled": true,
  "visor.complexity.thresholds.low": 5,
  "visor.complexity.thresholds.medium": 10,
  "visor.complexity.thresholds.high": 20
}
```

### Technical Details & Privacy

Visor is built on **Tree-sitter** for robust code parsing and **Mermaid.js** for high-quality diagram rendering. All code analysis and flowchart generation are performed locally on your machine, ensuring your code remains **completely private and secure**.

**Editor Compatibility**: Visor works seamlessly with VS Code, Cursor, and Windsurf editors. The extension automatically detects your environment and applies compatibility optimizations when needed.
